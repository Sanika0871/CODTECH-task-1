Overview of the project

Project- Simple Calculator

Objective-

The main objective of the simple calculator project is to develop a basic program that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
It introduces students or beginners to key programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, loops, and basic computational logic.

Key Activities-

Defining the Requirements:

Specify the operations to be supported (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Identify the user interaction method (e.g., command-line input/output).

Designing the Calculator:

Plan the program flow, such as displaying a menu, taking input, and processing operations.
Use a switch-case or if-else block to handle different user-selected operations.

Coding and Implementation:

Write a program in Java to accept inputs for numbers and the desired operation.
Implement the logic for performing calculations.
Handle edge cases, such as division by zero.

Testing:

Test the program with valid inputs (e.g., 10 + 5).
Test edge cases (e.g., dividing by zero, non-numeric input).

Technologies Used-
Programming Language:

Java: Used for implementing the calculator logic due to its versatility, ease of use, and robust standard libraries.

Development Tools:

JDK (Java Development Kit): To compile and run the Java program.
IDE (Optional): IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code to write and debug the code.

Command-Line Interface (CLI):

Simple input and output interaction via the terminal or console.

Project Benefits-
Teaches fundamental programming concepts.
Introduces Java syntax, control structures, and user input handling.
Provides a foundation for more advanced projects involving GUIs or APIs.

This project serves as a stepping stone for building more complex calculators with advanced features like scientific functions or graphical interface.
